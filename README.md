# win10_debloat

This is my "automated" version of [Windows10-Privacy](https://github.com/adolfintel/Windows10-Privacy), by [@adolfintel](https://github.com/adolfintel).

Personally, I use it with custom implementations from [Tr0n](https://github.com/bmrf/tron) and [Win10-Initial-Setup-Script](https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script).
